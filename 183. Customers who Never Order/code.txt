Question: 
Table: Customers

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer.
 

Table: Orders

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| customerId  | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
customerId is a foreign key (reference columns) of the ID from the Customers table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.
 

Write a solution to find all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in any order.


Concept:
This can be solved simply using set difference. This query will look for the ids of every customer who ordered and then 
subtract it from the list of all customers to get the name of all customers who never order


Query:

SELECT c.name AS Customers
FROM Customers c
WHERE c.id NOT IN (SELECT c1.id
                    FROM Customers c1, Orders o
                    WHERE c1.id = o.customerID)
